# comments-kanban
Haskell microservice to add comments to a task in mini kanban project

<h2>About the project:</h2>
<p>The idea was to create a rest microservice in haskell and mainly putting haskell code into "production" while also learning functional programming. The comments kanban is a microservice that brings comments in any task in any board at the mini-kanban microservice. </p>

<h2>Initializing the project</h2>
<p>Start docker and run the following command in your terminal</p>

```
"docker-compose up -d --build"
P.S this part might take a while, due to haskell being a compiled language.
```
